# VeraDemo - Blab-a-Gag (Express-JS)

### Notice

This project is intentionally vulnerable! It contains known vulnerabilities and security errors in its code and is meant as an example project for software security scanning tools such as Veracode. Please do not report vulnerabilities in this project; the odds are theyâ€™re there on purpose :) .

## About

Blab-a-Gag is a fairly simple forum type application which allows:

- Users can post a one-liner joke.
- Users can follow the jokes of other users or not (listen or ignore).
- Users can comment on other users messages (heckle).

### URLs

- `/feed` shows the jokes/heckles that are relevant to the current user.
- `/blabbers` shows a list of all other users and allows the current user to listen or ignore.
- `/profile` allows the current user to modify their profile.
- `/login` allows you to log in to your account
- `/register` allows you to create a new user account
- `/tools` shows a tools page that shows a fortune or lets you ping a host.
- `/reset` allows the user to reset the database

## Run Docker image

If you don't already have Docker this is a prerequisite.  Make sure your Docker engine is up to date.  To check, run:

	docker compose version

The version should be >= 2.22.

(NOTE: Currently only local development is supported - there are no images to download from Docker Hub)

### Download Docker

Visit [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and download your compatible version.  Follow installation instructions.  Open the Docker app. 

To run the container, clone the respository and in the project folder run this:

    docker compose up -d

For development, comment out the last line of the `Dockerfile` and then uncomment the `CMD ["npm","run","devStart"]` line.
Then run:

    docker compose up -d
    docker compose watch

Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Then register as a new user and add some feeds.

## Run locally

You can run a local/debug version of the app, while still using the MySQL database Docker container.  (See above for installing Docker)

To run the program locally:
    Change the ``.env`` file to say ``MYSQL_HOST = 'localhost'``
Then:

    npm install
    docker compose create database
    docker compose start database
    node app.js

Or if you are developing, swap `node app.js` for `npm run devStart`

Navigate to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Then register as a new user and add some feeds.
